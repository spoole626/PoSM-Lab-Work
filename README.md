Matlab code that was used in Harvey Mudd's PoSM Lab (Physics of Soft Matter). The lab researches the kinematics of orangisms who use Latch-Mediated spring actuated systems (LaMSA). 

Videos were taken of long pieces of elastomer with tick-markings was stretched between two points and then let go. This code assisted team members in identifying the location and counting the amount of tick marks to be used in further analyzation of each indivicual tick mark's speed.
